Description

The ReSearch Project explores the intersection of technology and user behavior in academic research. By analyzing patterns in how users interact with digital research platforms, the project aims to identify challenges, streamline workflows, and propose user-centered design solutions that enhance the overall research experience. The findings are supported by data-driven insights and presented through a comprehensive report and a final presentation.
